# responsive-website
Responsive website just using HTML and CSS.

The site was proposed by a course on responsive layouts from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and modifications by me.

The website is from a company called [Apeperia](http://merielylima.github.io/responsive-website/), which offers maintenance services and the creation of customized applications for other companies and people.
