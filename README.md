# responsive-website
Responsive website just using HTML and CSS using Media Queries .

The site was proposed by a course on [responsive layouts](https://www.alura.com.br/curso-online-mobile-first-layouts-responsivos) from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and the modifications were made by me.

The website is from a company called [Apeperia](http://merielylima.github.io/responsive-website/), which offers maintenance services and the creation of customized applications for other companies and people.
